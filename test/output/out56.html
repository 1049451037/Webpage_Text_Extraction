He was one of those guys, Mr Liverpool.</p><p>"Any player will tell you they've had a spat with Ronnie. He'd be the first to tell you off and the first to be on your side to become a better player. He will be remembered with great love and affection. Ronnie Moran is one of the greats of Liverpool."</p><p>Former Liverpool midfielder <b>Ray Houghton</b> described Moran as "a key member" of successful coaching teams at the club.</p><p>"He would have done anything for the club," Houghton told BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast.</p><p>"I learned so much from him and he nurtured so many good players. A very humble man and a very honest one."</p><p><b>Joe Corrigan,</b> who arrived at Anfield as goalkeeper coach in 1994, said Moran was a "fantastic" and "private" man.</p><p>"He helped me so much, showed me what Liverpool Football Club was all about and he was a great asset to the club," Corrigan told 5 live.</p><p>"He had done everything at the club, even washing the kit. I don't think the players feared him, he wasn't that type of person. He had respect from players as they responded to his knowledge of the game."</p><p>Former Liverpool goalkeeper <b>Ray Clemence </b>described Moran as a "driving force in the dressing room", while the club's former defender Gary Gillespie said his record "speaks for itself".</p><div id="bbc-morph-sport-embed-playbuzz-url-https-www-playbuzz-com-bbcsport-ronnie"><div id="u230109445983544"><p data-react-checksum="-1481933770" data-reactid=".25qe8w8n4sg"><span data-reactid=".25qe8w8n4sg.0">This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and </span><a data-reactid=".25qe8w8n4sg.1" href="/usingthebbc/cookies/how-can-i-change-my-bbc-cookie-settings/">cookies are enabled</a><span data-reactid=".25qe8w8n4sg.2"> or update your browser</span></p></div></div><p><b>Peter Reid,</b> who appeared in 13 Merseyside derbies for Everton during the 1980s, <a href="http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2017/03/22/rip-ronnie-moran">told the Everton website:</a> "I'm devastated. Ronnie was a good football man who had a wicked sense of humour.</p><p>"One of my best memories of him were the derbies, which as we all know, are fiery affairs.</p><p>"One year, they beat us at Anfield and as I was walking off the pitch, Ronnie came over to me and said: 'Hey lad, you played well'. Let's just say I gave him an Anglo-Saxon response!</p><p>"The following year we beat them at Anfield and I couldn't see Ronnie in the tunnel so I marched straight into the boot room, found him, and said: 'Unlucky, you played well'.</p><p>"I got the same Anglo-Saxon response!</p><p>"Ronnie knew the game inside out.
