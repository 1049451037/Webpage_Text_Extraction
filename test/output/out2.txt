      Analysts are looking ahead to the open of trading on Wall Street at 13:30 GMT.
     
      "The rest of the day’s trading will likely be dependent on
how the Dow Jones fares after the bell rings on Wall Street," said Connor Campbell from SpreadEx.
     
      "After stagnating
for most of March the Dow suffered a near 300 point drop on Tuesday, taking it
to its lowest level in nearly a month; that fall has arguably been coming, with
little in the way of justification – bar blind Trump optimism – to keep it so
close to its record peak," he added.

       Crude oil prices continue to fall.
      
      North Sea Brent Crude is down 80 cents or 1.6% at $50.16 per barrel.
     
      On Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a bigger than expected rise in US oil inventories last week.
     
      That helped give traders the jitters, who had been hoping that supplies of oil were getting tighter, thanks to promised cuts in production by big oil producers, including OPEC nations.
     
      "WTI crude [the US benchmark] may be in store for
further punishment moving forward with production in the United States rising
consistently and the inflated inventories simply counteracting the efforts of
OPEC to stabilize the oil markets," said FXTM research analyst, Lukman Otunuga.

     FTSE 100 down; Kingfisher slides
    
      The
      
       FTSE 100
      
      has kicked off with modest losses, down 0.6% at 7,332. That follows a sharpish loss for shares on Wall Street on Tuesday.
     
      Kingfisher is one of the big losers with a 3% fall.
     
      However the owner of B&Q was cautious about the outlook for this year.
