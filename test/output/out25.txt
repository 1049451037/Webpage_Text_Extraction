Thailand's blind children's orchestra - BBC News
  The Thai Blind Orchestra is made up of young musicians and is run by a man whose daytime job is managing an elephant conservation centre.
 
  It鈥檚 one of a very few initiatives in Thailand that gives blind children a chance to learn to play instruments.
 
  A BBC team went to meet the group at an open-air concert they held at a national park in the north east of Thailand.
