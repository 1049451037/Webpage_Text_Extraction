"She has clearly emerged as someone powerful, if not a designated political heir to her father."</p><p>Last year her name appeared in the so-called Panama Papers, suggesting she and two of her brothers had links to undeclared offshore companies and accounts being used to acquire luxury properties in London.</p><p>Her father dismissed the accusations calling the leaks the work of people "targeting me and my family for their political aims".</p><p>The allegations are being examined by Pakistan's Supreme Court and the verdict is expected within weeks.</p><hr><h2>The rock and roll dancer - Russia</h2><figure>

</figure><p>Russian president Vladimir Putin is notoriously protective of his private life, and until recently very little was known about his two daughters.</p><p>"Russian officials treat any media interest in them with utter suspicion," says BBC Russian's Famil Ismailov. "It's left to journalists to test how far they can push and much of the information has never been confirmed by the family."</p><p>In 2015, the youngest daughter, Yekaterina, emerged into the spotlight after it was revealed she was living in Moscow using the name Katerina Tikhonova.</p><p>Since then Russians have learned from various media reports that she is married to businessman Kirill Shamalov, the son of one of her father's old friends, and that the couple are worth an estimated $2bn through investments in the gas and petrochemicals industries. </p><p>Now aged 30, she runs publicly-funded projects on 'intellectual development' at Moscow State University. </p><p>She reportedly oversees contracts worth several million dollars and has members of Putin's inner circle as advisors.</p><p>Tikhonova is also an enthusiastic acrobatic rock and roll dancer, coming fifth at the 2013 World Championships in Switzerland.</p><hr><h2>The favourite daughter - Turkey</h2><figure>
