</figure><p>A 430-million-year-old fossil discovered "frozen in time" in ancient volcanic rock has been named after Sir David Attenborough.</p><p>The tiny crustacean, measuring less than 1cm long, was found by researchers in Herefordshire.</p><p>It has been named Cascolus Ravitis, the first word a Latin rendering of the Old English equivalent to Attenborough.</p><p>Ravitis is is a reference to Roman name for Leicester, where Sir David lived on the city's university campus.</p><p>The fossil was given its name by researchers from the universities of Oxford, Leicester, Yale and Imperial College London.</p><p>Sir David said: “The biggest compliment that a biologist or palaeontologist can pay to another one is to name a fossil in his honour and I take this as a very great compliment.”</p><p>The fossil is the latest in a long list of species and objects to be named after the famous naturalist and broadcaster.</p><p>Others include:</p><ul>
<li>A pygmy grasshopper species named Electrotettix attenboroughi found in 2014 preserved in amber in the Dominican Republic</li>
<li>A long-beaked echidna given the name Zaglossus attenboroughi which lives in the forested areas of New Guinea</li>
<li>A rare butterfly named Euptychia attenboroughi, in honour of his love for butterflies, which live in tropical forests in places like Colombia and Brazil</li>
<li>A flightless weevil from Indonesia was given the name Trigonopterus attenboroughi</li>
<li>A species of wildflower named the Attenborough Hawkweed discovered in the Brecon Beacons</li>
<li>Dinosaur Attenborosaurus conybeare - a type of plesiosaur which lived millions of years ago</li>
<li>A polar research ship called the RRS Sir David Attenborough - which was given his name despite the title "Boaty McBoatface" topping a public vote.</li>

</figure><p>Sir David, who turned 90 in May last year, grew up on the campus of the former University College Leicester where his father Frederick was the principal. </p><p>Lead researcher Prof David Siviter, from the University of Leicester, said Sir David had inspired his interest in natural history.</p><p>He said one of the reasons Sir David became a great naturalist was by collecting Jurassic rock fossils in the Leicester countryside.</p><p>The newly discovered creature is a tiny arthropod - a group of animals that includes modern insects, spiders, shrimp, and crayfish.</p><p>Prof Siviter said the fossil found in the rocks had been "frozen in time" by volcanic ash.</p><p>“It’s like an undersea Pompeii,” he told BBC News. </p><p>It was so well preserved, the research team were able to use 3D computer modelling to show its features -  including minuscule eyes, delicate antennae, multiple jointed limbs and a tough exoskeleton.</p><p><a href="http://pages.email.bbc.com/subscribe">Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning</a></p>
