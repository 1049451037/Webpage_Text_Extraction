                                Speaking about Sterling's fitness concerns, Southgate said: "I've got to balance what is right for Wednesday and what is right for Sunday as well, so we'll keep monitoring that.
                               
                                "We are in a position where we haven't been able to get all the players on the field until today and then you've got to see how they come through training.
                               
                                "It's a little bit later than we'd have liked but that's the nature of it."

                                 injured defender Phil Jones.
                                
                                Former Arsenal attacker Lukas Podolski will captain Germany as he wins his 130th and final cap.
                               
                                Mesut Ozil, Julian Draxler, Mario Gomez and

                                With Germany hosting England in an international friendly on Wednesday, we've scoured our picture archive for some of the more obscure German players to feature in the Premier League.
                               
                                It's not meant to be easy - we think anyone getting more than 70% has either done a reverse image search or has a great career ahead of them in pub quizzes.
                               
                                Let's get started and see if you know you can accurately tell Stefan Malz from Stefan Schnoor.

                                      Such a sad loss of my great friend Ronnie Moran. Our thoughts are with his wife Joyce and @paulmoran62 and all his family.

                                "One of my best memories of him were the derbies, which as we all know, are fiery affairs.
                               
                                "One year, they beat us at Anfield and as I was walking off the pitch, Ronnie came over to me and said: ‘Hey lad, you played well’. Let’s just say I gave him an Anglo-Saxon response!
                               
                                "The following year we beat them at Anfield and I couldn’t see Ronnie in the tunnel so I marched straight into the boot room, found him, and said: ‘Unlucky, you played well’.
                               
                                “I got the same Anglo-Saxon response!"

                                Ronnie Moran's place in the history of Liverpool FC
is secure. Yes he was a player - good enough to span the mid 50's to the
mid 60's, but as a coach, his knowledge was immense. Would he have made a
great Liverpool manager? Absolutely! A true gentleman too.

                                Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson has paid a moving tribute to Reds ex-coach Ronnie Moran, who has died aged 83. (BBC Sport app users click on the link to see his Instagram post).
                               
                                 The reason being captain of Liverpool Football Club is such a huge honour is because legendary figures like Ronnie Moran held it before I did.I wasn't lucky enough to work with Ronnie but I had the great fortune of being in his company on the occasions when he came to Melwood to walk around the training pitch and although we all regarded him as a true great, he was as humble and down to earth as anyone you could ever come across.I know I speak for all of the current players when I say that we are all deeply saddened by Ronnie's passing and the greatest tribute we can pay to him is to give everything we've got for Liverpool Football Club just as he did each and every single day during the 49 years he spent here.

                                British wrestler Chinu Sandhu, who won Commonwealth bronze in 2014, has been banned for four years after failing an out-of-competition drugs test.
                               
                                Sandhu, 29, who competed in the 125kg men's freestyle, tested positive for an anabolic steroid in September.

                                Ronnie Moran was assistant to Roy Evans during much of his spell as manager of the club in the late 1990s.
                               
                                 Evans told BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast:
                                
                                "I joined in 1964 and he was playing in those days, then he became a coach. He was one of those guys, Mr Liverpool.
                               
                                "Any player will tell you they've had a spat with Ronnie. He'd be the first to tell you off and the first to be on your side to become a better player. He will be remembered with great love and affection. Ronnie Moran is one of the greats of Liverpool."

                                Liverpool have responded to the death of their former player and coach Ronnie Moran.
                               
                                 The statement:
                                
                                 Liverpool Football Club is deeply saddened by the passing of Ronnie Moran.
                                
                                 Moran, one of the most influential figures in the club’s history, has died at the age of 83.
                                
                                 Ronnie is fondly remembered for his 49 years of service to Liverpool, during which time he represented the club with distinction as a player, coach, physio, reserve-team coach, assistant manager and caretaker manager.
                                
                                 The thoughts of everyone at Liverpool Football Club are with Ronnie’s wife Joyce, his children, family and many friends.

                                      Rest in peace, Ronnie.

                                Moran made 379 appearances for Liverpool between 1952 and 1966 and was the club's longest-serving employee when he retired in 1999.
                               
                                He joined the coaching staff in 1966 and twice filled in as caretaker manager - after Kenny Dalglish's resignation in 1991 and following Graeme Souness' heart surgery in 1992.
                               
                                His son confirmed he had passed away after a short illness.

                                "Devastaiting news. He was such a key member of Liverpool for so many years. He would have done anything for the club. He loved everything about Liverpool Football Club.
We knew him as 'Bugsy'.
                               
                                "He loved being at the training every day. The two words I remember at Liverpool were attitude and commitment. I got that from Ronnie.
He could be tough. I remember when we won the league, he went around with a box of medals asking who had played enough games to deserve one. That was his way, forget what you'd did in the past.

                                The Manchester United defender-midfielder-defender suffered a toe injury during training with the England squad in the build up to the Germany game in Dortmund.

                                The 25-year-old was injured in an innocuous training ground tackle at St George's Park, with reports claiming it involved United team-mate Chris Smalling (see pic above).
                               
                                Anything to say on the matter Chris?
