"We can't host the Games in 2028 because we don't have the project available for 2028.</p><p>"We have the guarantees, we have the public support, we have the political support, we have 95% of existing venues. This is the fourth bid from Paris and 2024 is the centenary of the Games in Paris."</p><ul><li><a href="/sport/olympics/39183183">Read more: Dan Roan blogs on the IOC's likely two-Games deal</a></li></ul><p>There have been <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-olympics2024-20170317-story.html">reports</a> the losers of the 2024 bid could be awarded the following Games in 2028.</p><p>"All options are on the table, and this includes also the 2024-2028 procedure and vote," said IOC president Thomas Bach last week.</p><p>Estanguet, a three-time Olympic canoeing champion, says the bid committee has been in discussions with the IOC since the beginning of the bidding process.</p><p>He added that the bid committee has talked through the issue of 2028 with the IOC on several occasions.</p><p>Earlier this week, Eric Garcetti, the mayor of LA, warned the Americans were intent on winning the right to host the 2024 Games. </p><p>"We are competing for 2024," he told insidethegames.
