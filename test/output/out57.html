</figure><p>A friend of the Charleston gunman who killed nine worshippers at an African-American church has been jailed for lying to police about the tragedy.</p><p>Before his sentencing, 22-year-old Joey Meek tearfully told the court he was not sure if he would survive in prison.</p><p>"I'm really, really sorry. A lot of beautiful lives were taken," he told bereaved relatives gathered in court.</p><p>His friend, Dylan Roof killed nine worshippers during a Bible study in a church in South Carolina.</p><p>Meek pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and failure to report a crime.</p><p>"I don't know if I'll make it out of prison alive. I'm scared," he added before the federal judge handed down his sentence of more than two years. </p><ul>

</ul><p>Prosecutors said that white supremacist Roof had told Meek about the plot a week before the attack.</p><p>He said Roof had shared his violent plans during a night at Meek's house as they drank vodka, took drugs and played video games. </p><p>In filing documents, his lawyer said that his "failure to appreciate the seriousness of Roof's statements is not unusual in today's shock value culture".</p><figure>

</figure><p>Judge Richard Gergel said Meek's punishment should serve as a deterrent against anyone else who hears of a serious crime and fails to report it.</p><p>Meek's "failure to make an earlier report is tragic and deeply regrettable, but his failure to report was not a violation of federal criminal law," the judge wrote, having ruled earlier that Meek could only be prosecuted for his actions after the attack that claimed nine lives.</p><p>The judge added that "the danger he exposed to the community is extraordinary" because he did not call police to identify Roof as a suspect, and that Roof could have committed more attacks while on the run.</p><p>Meek's lawyer, Deborah Barbier, said in a statement outside the courtroom that "Joey sincerely hopes that anyone who has a friend who is talking about hurting someone will take it seriously, learn from his mistake and notify the proper authorities immediately''.</p><p>Meek and Roof both met at school but later drifted apart.</p><p>They rekindled their friendship when Roof contacted Meek on Facebook to say he had seen his mugshot online.</p><p>Meek had a previous criminal record for burglary.</p>
