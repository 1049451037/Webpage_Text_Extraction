</figure><p>Germany says it will deport two men born in the country but whose parents are foreign - the first such case in German history.</p><p>The men, a 27-year-old Algerian and a 22-year-old Nigerian, were arrested last month on suspicion of planning a terror attack.</p><p>A gun and a flag of the so-called Islamic State were found at their homes during police raids in the central city of Gottingen.</p><p>But the men have never been charged.</p><p>The criminal proceedings were dropped because police never established whether the suspects had planned to carry out an attack.  Police say the two men are "dangerous".</p><p>Lower Saxony Interior Minister Boris Pistorius said the deportations would take place as soon as possible, and certainly before mid-April.</p><p>He said discussions were already under way with Algeria and Nigeria to facilitate this, and the two men would be subject to a "life-long re-entry ban", preventing their return to Germany.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if the two men would appeal against the decision.</p><p>Germany determines citizenship by the nationalities of one or both parents and also a person's place of birth. </p><p>The country has been on high alert since <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38377428">the Berlin Christmas market attack on 19 December, that left 12 people dead and dozens injured.</a></p>
