</figure><h2>How is Paul Manafort connected to the US president?</h2><p>Mr Manafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016, and helped to secure the president's nomination for the race. He was promoted to campaign chairperson in June.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37134440">But he was forced out in August 2016</a>, when reports emerged that the Ukrainian government had uncovered ledgers pledging more than $12m (拢9.2m) in undisclosed cash payments for his work with Mr Yanukovych.</p><p>He was replaced by the combination of Stephen Bannon and Kellyanne Conway - both now senior White House staff. </p><p>The BBC's Jane O'Brien said at the time that Mr Manafort had been removed mainly due to the campaign's poor performance, rather than the "distraction" of the Ukraine allegations.</p><figure>
