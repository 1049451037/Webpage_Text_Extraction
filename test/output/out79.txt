   President Donald Trump joked that Nasa could send the US Congress to Mars as he signed a bill that guaranteed funding for the space agency for the next financial year.
  
   The bill includes money to go towards a manned mission to Mars, Nasa's next big goal.
  
   Despite this, the Nasa budget fell slightly, from $19.5bn ( æ‹¢15.6bn) in 2017 to $19.1bn in 2018.
