         Silent tribute and tears at Brussels airport
        
         King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium lead a minute's silence at Zaventem airport in Brussels.
        
          King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium led a minute's silence at Zaventem airport in Brussels, as the country remembered the bomb attacks on the capital's airport and underground system, which killed 32 people.
         
          More than 300 people were wounded in the attacks, which were claimed by the so-called Islamic State (IS) group.
