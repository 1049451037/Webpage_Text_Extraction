</figure><p>The Syrian Observatory said the al-Mansoura air strike meant at least 116 civilians, including 18 children and 23 women, had been killed in suspected coalition air strikes in the past two weeks. </p><p>Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently put the civilian death toll at 101, but did not appear to include any of those feared dead in al-Mansoura.</p><p>Earlier this month, the coalition <a href="http://www.inherentresolve.mil/News/News-Releases/Article/1102695/combined-joint-task-force-operation-inherent-resolve-monthly-civilian-casualty/">said</a> its air strikes in Syria and Iraq had unintentionally killed at least 220 civilians since August 2014. However, human rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/21/five-guidelines-promote-respect-international-law-combatting-isis">believe</a> the true figure is likely far higher. </p><p>Airwars, an organisation that tracks allegations of civilian deaths, <a href="https://airwars.org/civilian-casualty-claims/">reports</a> that at least 2,590 civilians are likely to have died.</p><p>Later on Wednesday, new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will host the first meeting of the entire 68-member coalition since December 2014.</p><p>US officials said the meeting aimed to accelerate efforts to defeat IS in Raqqa and Mosul, the group's last major urban stronghold in neighbouring Iraq.</p><p>Elsewhere in Syria on Wednesday, rebels and allied jihadists continued two surprise offensives inside the capital, Damascus, and north of the city of Hama.</p>
