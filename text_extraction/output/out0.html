<div property="articleBody">
<p>A pilot who was found drunk in the cockpit before a flight in Canada has pleaded guilty to being impaired while in control of an aircraft.</p><p>Miroslav Gronych was found slumped in his seat with his pilot's wings attached upside down on his uniform.</p><p>He had more than three times the legal limit of alcohol in his body.</p><p>His plane, part of the Sunwing budget airline, later left Calgary for Cancun, Mexico, with a different pilot. There were more than 100 people on board.</p><p>Mr Gronych, 37, is facing a possible one-year prison sentence, sought by the prosecution. </p><p>"I can't even describe how ashamed I am," he said in court on Tuesday, adding: "My kids will be punished for my mistakes."</p><p>The court was told that when Mr Gronych, a Slovak national, boarded the plane at around 07:00 (14:00 GMT) on New Year's Eve, he struggled to hang up his coat and was slurring his words. </p><p>According to the statement read to the court, the co-pilot then suggested that Mr Gronych leave the plane, but he sat in the pilot's chair and appeared to pass out "resting his face on the window".</p><p>He was also an hour late for check-in, which he said was because he got lost going through security. </p><p>An empty bottle of vodka was later discovered in Mr Gronych's hotel room.</p><p>"Mr Gronych put the lives of 105 people at risk," prosecutor Rose Greenwood said on Tuesday, adding: "Hopefully he will never be permitted to fly again."</p>
